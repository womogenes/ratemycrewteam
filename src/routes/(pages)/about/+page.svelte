    # About
    
RateMyTeam is a website that provides two functions: first, a search engine that allows users to find relevant information about a sports team, such as its location, coach contact information, recruitment information, regional and national rankings, and so on. With this, we aim to provide greater transparency and available information for new athletes. The second is a review function that allows users to review teams based on team culture and coaching quality, and for users to view these reviews. Users can also “rate” the team on a scale from 1-5 stars with their review. With this, we aim to promote healthier team cultures / environments and better emotional wellbeing for athletes. \
 
Many athletes join a team not knowing anything about team culture or coaches apart from rumors. Some athletes hope to be on a team that can support them in their athletic endeavors including college recruitment. Finding all this information is difficult without actually joining a team. Many athletes end up regretting their decision and wasting time on a team they don’t enjoy being on or on a team that doesn’t satisfy their needs.

First-person accounts are the best way to get to know a team without having to join it. RateMyTeam will allow athletes and their families to see reviews and make informed decisions. They will also have the opportunity to connect to experienced athletes and coaches to get more information to aid them in making a decision. RateMyTeam also has the potential to encourage coaches to prioritize team culture so that they can market their team better on the website.

“Our goal is simple: to empower junior athletes and their parents to make well-informed decisions when entering the world of athletics. We can transform youth sports by promoting safety, well-being, and transparency for all athletes,” says CEO and co-founder Kaitlin Yeoh.

Users will be introduced to a clean and easy to navigate interface while not missing out on any relevant information. Users have the freedom to search for any team they want and see real reviews. Users can also easily find contact information for coaches and athletes to gain a better understanding of a team.
